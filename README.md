This project is for me to put together all of the skills I have learned over the passed year with regards to C#.

The main idea behind this little project is to gain an understanding of what programming concepts to use and when to use them. 

In addition I would also like to put it into a production environment and allow a user to manage their own content. So in a way its a "CMS" but only in its own way. 

This "CMS" will only affect this particular site. It will not be used for other sites.
